<h1>Textube Desktop Utility</h1>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Often when I'd be coding and working with another person, I found myself wanting to quickly share code snippets or files with them. When I made this project originally, my typical answer to this problem was to pull up a website like pastebin or drop a file into my Dropbox public folder, but I wanted something faster, so I created Textube.</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>I made Textube as a desktop tray application paired with a PHP server application that handled file uploads and URL shortening (to the host <code>http://textu.be</code>). I developed these client and server components of Textube over a two week span to be turned in for an AP Computer Science course in high school.</p>
<p>I used JNA to make a system-wide key listener to bind actions to shortcuts and I created a plugin class that could be extended to create custom tools, the included tools being Upload and Evaluate.</p>

<em>Uploading the text/file from the clipboard. (Completion notification absent).</em></p>
<p><img src="/static/projects/textube/evaluate.gif" alt="Evaluate action" />
<em>Evaluating a math expression on the clipboard.</em></p>
<h2>Assets</h2>
<p>As Textube was one of my first comprehensive projects, I did not follow best coding practices in several cases. In particular, the PHP and web server code is quite bad and uses <code>mysql_*</code> functions, for example. Also notable is the "Cancel" button text being cut short in the above upload panel due to using static dimensions rather than a proper layout manager. Regardless, I've included the code split into desktop app and server app assets.</p>
