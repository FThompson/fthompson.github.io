# Smart Opioid Prescription Management Device Capstone

For my Human-Centered Design & Engineering (HCDE) capstone project, I worked with a team of three other HCDE students to create a smart device and companion app to help postoperative patients follow their pain management prescriptions as they go through the recovery process. Our project was sponsored by The University of Washington and Seattle Children's Hospital, including Dr. Lance Patak and resident doctors Stuart Solomon and Jacob Gross.

## Overview

Opioids provide necessary pain relief to postoperative patients. However, opioids can be addictive, dangerous, and are often subject to misuse. Our project, an in-home oral Patient-Controlled Analgesia (PCA) device, addresses these issues by providing patients with the guidance they need to manage their pain effectively during their postoperative recovery.

Our team researched, designed, prototyped, evaluated, and iterated a PCA device and companion app that monitor and manage opioid prescriptions while connecting patients to doctors throughout the postoperative recovery phase.

## Our Design Process

My team's capstone project took place over two quarters: the first quarter encompassed teambuilding and planning two week sprints and goals to be delivered during the second quarter of the capstone. Each team member acted as project manager for one sprint phase.
